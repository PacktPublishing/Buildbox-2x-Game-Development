##Instructions and Navigations
You’ll need a Mac or PC that meets the minimum specifications for Buildbox. You should
also have either a trial or full license for Buildbox version 2.x. Having graphics software
such as Gimp or Adobe Photoshop is highly encouraged, but not required (as for the
examples in this book we have created the assets for you). Similarly, having some sort of
audio editing software (such as Adobe Audition) is highly encouraged, but not necessary.
